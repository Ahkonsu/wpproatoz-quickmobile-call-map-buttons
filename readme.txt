---

== Installation ==

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the 'Settings > Mobile Call Now & Map Buttons' page to configure the plugin


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How is the maps button created? =

The address is built with a Google Maps URL query. Your entered location (address or GPS coord) values are constructed into a link like so:

`https://maps.google.com/?q=( street, city, province/state, country, postal/zip or latitude,longitude)`

If you're having troubles with your address, please be sure your business listing is correct on [google.com/maps](https://google.com/maps/) first, or use the GPS Coordinates option in the plugin.

If your *google.com/maps/* listing is incorrect, don't hesitate talking to Google about it, in our experience, they're eager to resolve map issues.


= What Format For GPS Coordinates? =

Please use the decimal degrees format (`dd.ddddd`) for GPS coordinates. Do not enter the degree symbol or N/E/S/W direction mention or commas. For example, Kamloops BC Canada would be:

*Latitude:* `50.6745`
*Longitude:* `-120.3273`


= The buttons are hiding my footer =

This should not happen, but is due to a CSS conflict between the plugin and your theme. 


= The buttons are appearing above lightbox / popups =

See **z-index** below.


= Advanced Options: z-index =

Absolute positioned elements on websites can be layered on top of one another using the CSS property `z-index`. This plugin has the buttons on a `z-index` of `998`. It's at this number as most popup's and lightbox's use `999` or higher.

If your theme has something hidden behind the buttons, or the buttons are above something like Lightbox, try altering this number higher or lower.

= Advanced Options: Append to body =

This plugin puts itâ€™s HTML at the bottom of a page using Wordpress's `wp_footer` hook. As specified by WordPress:

> the `wp_footer` action. Put this template tag immediately before `</body>` tag in a theme template

Some theme authors, for whatever their reason, ignore this, wrapping `wp_footer()` in a few elements, causing problems for plugins like this that expect it in a certain place.

Selecting the **Move plugin to absolute bottom** option, Javascript will edit the DOM and move the plugin to be at the absolute bottom of your theme, regardless of where the Theme author placed wp_footer hook.


= Advanced Options: Number Sanitizing =

Select this option to prevent the plugin from re-formatting your phone number. By default if you enter a value like

`1 (555) 555 - 5555`

For maximum browser compatibility, the plugin will sanitize the phone number to

`1-555-555-5555`

This sometimes effects Google Adwords phone numbers that expect a certain phone number format.


= Advanced Options: Profile =

This is your Wordpress setup, you may copy/paste it out when needing help troubleshooting your site.
